Hi! I’m Augusto, an undergrad at the University of Connecticut pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.  
Outside of computer science and academic work, some of my biggest passions are music and video games. I've also recently picked up photography and writing.  
I speak English, Spanish, and Norwegian fluently, and I'm currently studying Japanese.

Feel free to contact me through email or just look at some of the things I've worked on!

# University of Connecticut:

As a rising senior in the CSE program at UConn, my most recently completed courses include Algorithms and Complexity, Systems Programming, and Introduction to Computer Architecture.  
This past year, I studied abroad in Tokyo at Waseda University, focusing on fulfilling general education requirements and starting personal projects, although some of my plans were cut short.  
Alongside my classes, I have also worked with one of my professors on a cryptography library working in Dyalog APL.

# Games:

So far, I’ve worked on 2 released titles.
My goal for the next game I work on is to participate more as a programmer, although game soundtracks are a passion of mine.

Cubico is a top-down puzzle game in which you control a businessman trying to get to his interview. The original version was created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 42, and expanded upon slightly into the version above. My main work was in creating the original soundtrack and sound design.

Dead Weight is a story-driven 2D platformer that I completed with a small group at the end of our senior year of high school. It was developed over the course of 5 weeks. I also worked on the soundtrack and sound design of this one. As both games were created in small groups, we were all heavily involved in the design process.

# Music:

My soundcloud can be found on the sidebar.
Some of my more personal projects aren't on there, but feel free to listen to works in progress and some less structured stuff on [clyp](https://clyp.it/user/h3jrsze5)!
I’m also currently working on a year-long project in 2019 that I hope to put here at its conclusion.
