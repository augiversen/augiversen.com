Hi! Iâ€™m Augusto. My parents are ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ and ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª and I was born in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, but I've lived in all three countries. Currently WA, USA.

This page is mostly a placeholder until I figure out what I want to do with it. Feel free to contact me through the links on the sidebar!  

# Vocation:

I work as a software engineer for Chrome OS at Google (August 2021-). I strive to constantly challenge and develop my skills and continue working on interesting and impactful projects.

# Education:

I graduated from [UConn](https://uconn.edu/) with a degree in Computer Science & Engineering in Spring 2021. The most important classes I took during my undergrad were [CSE3150](https://catalog.uconn.edu/course-search/course/CSE/3150) with Yufeng Wu, the 2-course sequence for the [Senior Design Project](https://seniordesign.engr.uconn.edu/) with advisor Mukul Bansal, and Creative Writing at Waseda University during my study abroad (2019-20 academic year, cut short in March) in Tokyo with Steven Karl. 

# Avocations:

## Game development:

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://cubico.itch.io/cubico" target="_blank">CubiCo (August 2018)</a></p>
</blockquote>

CubiCo is a top-down puzzle game in which you control a businessman trying to get to his interview. The original version was created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 42. The version above was completed shortly after, fixing a few notable bugs. My main work was in creating the original soundtrack and sound design.

</blockquote>

Dead Weight is a story-driven 2D platformer that was completed in a small group at the end of our senior year of high school. It was developed over the course of 5 weeks. I also worked on the soundtrack and sound design of this one. As both games were created in small groups, we were all heavily involved in the design process.

## Music:

My SoundCloud can be found on the sidebar, and some less structured musical output can be found on my [clyp](https://clyp.it/user/h3jrsze5), although it is far from comprehensive.

## Etc.

A selection of other pursuits you'll just have to trust me on since they're not publicly online: language learning, photography, writing.
