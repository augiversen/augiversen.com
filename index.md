Welcome! Iâ€™m Augusto, a senior at the University of Connecticut pursuing a BSE in Computer Science and Engineering (Software Design & Development concentration).

I will be graduating in May, so I am looking for full-time positions. I am mainly interested in software engineering and game development, but have an open mind towards other potential career paths.

This page is only a brief look at my work - If you want more information, feel free to contact me through the links on the sidebar! 

# UConn:

I am currently in my last semester at UConn. An key part of this semester is the [Senior Design Project,](https://seniordesign.engr.uconn.edu/) where students work over the course of a year to design and develop a product according to the needs of sponsors. I am currently working with a teammate to develop the front-end of our web application design, using Angular and Bootstrap.

The [courses](https://catalog.uconn.edu/directory-of-courses/course/cse/) I have gotten the most from over my time at UConn are Data Structures & Object-Oriented Design, Algorithms and Complexity, and Systems Programming. Each of these courses were intensive looks at fundamental computer science topics, with accompanying assignments & projects that tested our application of these concepts.

During the 2019-20 academic year, I studied abroad at Waseda University in Tokyo. Although my program was cut short, the time spent there was used onn general education requirements and personal projects. 

Some of the program-adjacent subjects I have found an interest in at UConn include open source, cybersecurity, and blockchain technologies. Although I have not delved information these subjects to the extent I would like, I hope to find a structured way to pursue them in the near future alongside my main focuses.

# Games:

I have worked on two titles so far. One of my resolutions this year is to complete a more in-depth project, whether on my own or as part of a team.

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://cubico.itch.io/cubico" target="_blank">CubiCo (August 2018)</a></p>
</blockquote>

CubiCo is a top-down puzzle game in which you control a businessman trying to get to his interview. The original version was created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 42. The version above was completed shortly after, fixing a few bugs we wanted to take care of. My main work was in creating the original soundtrack and sound design.

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Yinabled/Dead-Weight/releases/tag/v1.0" target="_blank">Dead Weight (June 2017)</a></p>
</blockquote>

Dead Weight is a story-driven 2D platformer that was completed in a small group at the end of our senior year of high school. It was developed over the course of 5 weeks. I also worked on the soundtrack and sound design of this one. As both games were created in small groups, we were all heavily involved in the design process.

# Other:

My interest in software and game development stems from a passion for systems in general - from observation to design to implementation. Combined with a drive for creation, I enjoy delving into many different fields, and hope to apply this broader jack-of-all-trades mindset to my work.

I speak English, Spanish, and Norwegian natively (although I am a little rusty with the latter two), and I'm currently studying Japanese. 

My SoundCloud can be found on the sidebar, and some less structured musical output can be found on my [clyp](https://clyp.it/user/h3jrsze5), although it is far from comprehensive.

Thanks for reading! I've tried to keep it brief here, so shoot me a message if you have any questions or comments.
