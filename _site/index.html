      <section>

      <p>Hi! I’m Augusto, an undergrad at the University of Connecticut pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.<br />
Outside of academics/CS, some of my biggest passions are music and video games. I’ve also recently picked up photography.<br />
I speak English, Spanish, and Norwegian fluently, and am currently studying Japanese in preparation for study abroad.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me through the links here or just look at things I’ve worked on!</p>

<h1 id="games">Games:</h1>

<p>So far, I’ve worked on 2 released titles.
My goal for the next game I work on is to participate more as a programmer, although game soundtracks are a passion of mine.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Cubico is a top-down puzzle game in which you control a businessman trying to get to his interview. The original version was created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 42, and expanded upon slightly into the version above. My main work was in creating the original soundtrack and sound design.</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/Yinabled/Dead-Weight/releases/tag/v1.0" target="_blank">Dead Weight (June 2017)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dead Weight is a story-driven 2D platformer that I completed with a small group at the end of our senior year of high school. It was developed over the course of 5 weeks. I also worked on the soundtrack and sound design of this one. As both games were created in small groups, we were all heavily involved in the design process.</p>

<h1 id="music">Music:</h1>

<p>My soundcloud can be found on the sidebar.
Some of my more personal projects aren’t on there, but feel free to listen to works in progress and some less structured stuff on <a href="https://clyp.it/user/h3jrsze5">clyp</a>!
I’m also currently working on a year-long project in 2019 that I hope to put here at its conclusion.</p>

<h1 id="university-of-connecticut">University of Connecticut:</h1>

<p>As a rising junior in the CSE program at UConn, my most recently completed courses include Algorithms and Complexity, Systems Programming, and Introduction to Computer Architecture.<br />
I am currently on track to go into senior-level CS courses. However, I have decided to study abroad in Tokyo next year, focusing on a political science minor while hopefully developing my real-world and industry skills through personal projects and work.<br />
Alongside my classes, I work with a professor on a cryptography library working in Dyalog APL. I am also an active member of the UConn Gaming Club and WHUS (UConn’s college radio station).</p>
